# Lasso-in-Finance
Lasso is the basic regression analysis. The biggest problem I encountered when doing this program was data reading and data processing. The csv data provided by the teacher is much less explanatory variable than I expected, so it cannot be used directly. So I checked several data sets on Data yes and found that MktStockFactorsOneDayGet is particularly suitable. With the help of data, the next job is not too difficult.
I still have a follow-up idea of forming a complete strategy. The part that has been implemented in my program is: apply the optimal coefficient obtained from the regression analysis to all the stocks in a stock pool, find the best top 10 stocks, and calculate the purchase ratio of individual stocks based on the scores. The ideal follow-up is: every period of time (such as a week) to score the indicators of all stocks with coefficients, find the top 10 stocks with the highest scores, and adjust positions according to the scores. The requirements for data processing are still quite high. The member account of Data yes should be able to run on the platform (unfortunately, I don't have it yet ðŸ˜”).
